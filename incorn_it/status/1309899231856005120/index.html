  	      I feel like I can barely remember her, like if I don't focus it'll be as if she never existed. That's what I would want in her placeâ€”if I ever chose to leave a world I'd want to be forgotten by the people in it. If she feels the same, too bad. I loved her, I will remember her.

  	      I remember running around pushing her pram on the driveway doing big slides on the loose dirt, encouraged by her laughter (at least, I think I was, idk why I can remember the pram in so much detail, but not the child inside) until I got told off by a parent "a baby is not a toy!"

  	      I remember when she started crawling, I came home from school one day and was amazed to see that she knew how to crawl, and how much energy she had for it. She crawled around that house without nappies, we called her shits 'bombs' and joked that she was a terrorist planting them.

  	      I'm struggling to remember what she was like at 3, 4, and 5 though. I would have seen her all the time so I don't understand why I can't find any actual memories of her in those three years. Maybe because of the new baby?

  	      A couple years later when I moved back in, her friend from school was the younger sister of my oldest friend. Their mom gushed about how cute my sister was, compared how she spoke to Pollyanna, which isn't a reference I get.

  	      I played Yugioh and Dynasty Warriors with her. She apologised about a time years before that she'd done something bad and blamed me for it, and I got in trouble instead of her. I told her not to worry about it.

  	      I stayed for 2 years that time. I didn't really hang out with the kids much. Just for boring stuff, like chores or convincing them to get in the shower. Still, I think they kind of idolized me, the  way that kids that age will look up to a 19-year old.

  	      Next I saw them was after my daughter was born, mom brought them up for a week or two. We ended up borrowing the flat of a friend who was on vacation so my mom and sister didn't have to stay together. She would have been about 16 then.
