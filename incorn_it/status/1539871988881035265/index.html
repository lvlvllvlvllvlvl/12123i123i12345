Tweets in a community aren't shown to anybody outside of that community... unless they go to the community and look at the timeline, where they can see every tweet that's been posted to that community. <a href="https://twitter.com/zero_karma_l/status/1533741953258356737">https://twitter.com/zero_karma_l/status/1533741953258356737</a>
