  	      one of my earliest memories was touching a machete to see if it was sharp. it was. thought I was gonna get in so much trouble but when mom saw it she was just like "aww, did you get a cut?" and bandaged it

  	      another time I remember walking to the kitchen wearing pajamas and (open toe?) slippers to ask what she was doing. she was throwing cups and glasses on the floor to break them (just feeling a bit stressed). shard of glass went in my big toe and I got 12 stitches

  	      feel like this would have happened before the other one, because that one takes place in our second house. I can feel the hill outside through the wall that me and my sister used to carry a bucket of water up to the vege garden that had passionfruit, which we knew as grenadillas

  	      it's such a mysterious memory though because I still feel warm from the shower in it, so like, if mom was breaking stuff in the kitchen, who took me out of the shower? if it was my father, did he just leave mom to it?<br>and how could a 3 or 4 year old's toe get that many stitches?
