  	      I don't really understand music, but I've listened to it a lot and I really like the way the bass and piano work together during the first verse. Small changes the the piano part give each line a completely different texture, as does her voice.

  	      Then during the chorus the drums come in. I think the bass &amp; piano continues as before, but because it gets broken up by drum hits it's harder to follow. After the second verse starts it goes away and the electric guitar comes in. Second verse also has great lyrics.
