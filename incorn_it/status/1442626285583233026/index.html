  	      I had a look a while ago at what the expected effect on plant growth would be, and apparently it's hard to predict; some places that are currently good for growing food won't be and other places that weren't as good will be better.

  	      In general more co2 -&gt; more plant growth, though. Like, if you think about what greenhouses are good for you can see why greenhouse effect could imply more plants. So with the shipping industry gone and year-round local produce availability, we might just not bother to rebuild.

  	      Also note that after the last climate change event 10k years ago (sea level change 2x as much as what we can expect now) 90% of males were removed from the breeding pool. The mechanism for this is not clearly understood, but who knows, maybe it'll happen again.

  	      Obviously, the best case scenario is that we develop a way to synthesize feminizing hrt from completely local ingredients before this all goes down. Seems far-fetched, but a girl can dream right?
