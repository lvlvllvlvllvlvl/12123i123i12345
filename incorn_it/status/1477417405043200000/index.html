  	      I was wondering why there wasn't more "could transition have saved her" stuff, and I think it's because if you've read enough to get it, you also know that nothing could have saved him (image is of his widow's book) <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1477417402593804288-FIDXS-pVUAEk7DH.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1477417402593804288-FIDXS-pVUAEk7DH.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      Though while I don't think it would be hard to reclaim him, I don't think it's wise either. Like if dfw becomes trans culture, you'll get clueless normie trans girls reading him right when they're hormonal, and I think that would be a particularly cruel trick to play on them
