  	      I feel like these new puritans released videos for numbers and colours, idk why i can't find them. I remember remembering them in dec 2007, when i was driving cross country, but i don't remember when i actually saw them. The single came out in nov 2007, so it's a narrow window

  	      In the video for colours they broke stuff in slow motion, like water balloons filled with food coloring and fluorescent bulbs. i think the video for numbers was more abstract, like geometries or something? but i remember how that song sounds a lot more clearly than for colours
