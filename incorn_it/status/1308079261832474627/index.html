  	      I asked her how she felt when she did it, she said she was begging herself not to, but then once she did cut she stopped crying and everything felt calm. But she felt bad afterwards; it had been 2 years and all her other scars were already white.

  	      I told her it wasn't a big deal, but she didn't deserve that either, she deserved to be hugged and comforted and told that everything will be okay, not to have her pain minimised.
