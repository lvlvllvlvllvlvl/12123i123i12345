  	      I'm not mad at her for dying. If she wanted to go, that's her decision. It's just that I'm completely certain that she didn't want to. She was in acute pain and I could have helped. It was a full week since we'd last spoken.

  	      I wanted to tell her that I was on her side, that I'd thought that getting mom stable was necessary, but only cared about it because I thought it would help her (she said she didn't want to move out of the place she was sharing with mom)
