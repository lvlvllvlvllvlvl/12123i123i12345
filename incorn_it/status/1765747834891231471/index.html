  	      come to think of it l might have read Foucault's Pendulum when l was 16. l remember l checked it out of the library of the suburb l lived in that year, but idk what else l would have read from that library. probably Terry Pratchett mostly. oh, and sword of truth

  	      when l was 17 my favorite books were the coldfire trilogy, which l had also read some years before, so that's my best guess, but l really don't know what l would have said if you'd asked me when l was 16
