  	      @Moonsoother I'm sorry I didn't make it before you went to bed. Nz timezone. I didn't have a computer before this year (just Xbox), so I hadn't kept up with that game. I think I'd assumed that it would end at a certain point, but it looks like the world got reset.

  	      @Moonsoother Player-led world resets are pretty cool, too. A cookie-clicker browser game I played in summer 2002 had a mechanic where if one player from each faction cast an ultimate spell, it would begin the apocalypse, which was a free-for-all leaderboard fight, followed by a server reset.
