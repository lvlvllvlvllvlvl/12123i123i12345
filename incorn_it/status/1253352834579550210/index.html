  	      Suggests an alternate end-game to the current crisis. Maybe covid-19 will just devolve itself out of existence.

  	      But the part that makes me wonder whats up is that apparently there were both zoonotic and frozen strains of the virus isolated in New Jersey in 1976. Somehow Fort Dixon had an outbreak of H1N1 from pigs, H1N1 defrosted from the fifties, and H3N2 all at once.

  	      And the official line is that the outbreak was contained, yet the following year that same lineage of defrosted H1N1 appeared in Russia, and the US immediately noticed that it was a re-emergence of the '50s strain and started pointing the finger.
