  	      Daughter cut herself with the knife we got her for xmas. Not sure if it was correct to mention having seen stuff like this when talking to her about it - don't want to get her seeing ill intent in every interaction online. <a href="https://twitter.com/blastrotek/status/1342732150815272960">https://twitter.com/blastrotek/status/1342732150815272960</a>

  	      Shortly after this he cut himself with a friend from school and my wife was like "I wasn't surprised when I saw her" and "you know what Muslims are like" as if the other girl was a bad influence on our daughter, who had cut himself before starting middle school and meeting her
