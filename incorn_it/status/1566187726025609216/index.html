  	      Like, every queer behaviour imaginable made it into the dsm, but somehow this stereotypically cishet proclivity didn't? And even now, the phenomenon is very gendered (obviously the reactions to op contradict my point, but im gonna call transmisogyny)

  	      Because a man who likes being cheated on is a fetish (troilism) and a woman getting off to cheating on him is a fetish (cuckoldry) but who would ever call a man who can only get off when he's cheating a fetishist? That's just 'boys being men'; it's the trad protestant grindset
