  	      The one that was most like likely to be a request for information was a reply to a post about kaliacc "don't know who that is". Replied "good", but would have been happy to tell them about it if they'd asked a question

  	      Often wonder about the case where those were meant to be conversation starters: was that type of comment just what felt intuitive to them, or were they intentionally filtering for people who would take any opportunity to infodump

  	      Don't really understand sociable people, but would generally assume that an extravert would know what type of people they like to talk to. They seemed rat-aligned, so you'd think they'd know how they feel about people who prefer for questions to end with a '?'

  	      Then when they dmed, they asked a direct question then when the answer was no unfollowed a day later. Still can't figure out if they were trying to be friends and felt rejected or if they'd just decided that this wasn't a person they wanted to get to know <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1468515233777930241-FGE20ldVIAMrL4s.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1468515233777930241-FGE20ldVIAMrL4s.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>
