  	      There's a tired take that suggests l wamt people to hate me because it's better than accepting they don't care, but l don't think that applies to me like ok using the word hate is melodramatic but l know people don't literally hate me so much as stop caring

  	      really it's the possibility that people might like me that l find most stressful. it's just hundreds of logistical problems like this one, because l become aware of all the traits they dislike that l have but it's just not feasible to list every single one of my flaws in advance <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1616425049967452160-Fm6yA3CaMAIT-lt.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1616425049967452160-Fm6yA3CaMAIT-lt.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>
