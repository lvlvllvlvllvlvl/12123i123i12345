  	      My take on charcuterie discourse is that the 'rich people food' that is marketed towards poor and middle-class people is overpriced and tastes like shit

  	      Though I think that there's a type of rich person who buys that stuff as well, because they don't enjoy food, at least not sensually. Like, they after each bite they get geometry on their HUD and start guessing the ingredients so everyone knows how good they are at tasting

  	      But for real epicureans, like one couple I used to clean for, it's more than just buying expensive food to show off. Finding good stuff was a whole lifestyle for them. And a lot of the best stuff is really affordable, once you know where to buy it

  	      I grew up thinking that parmesan was a type of vomit-flavoured cardboard, but parmesan that comes from the parmesan region of France is actually delicious. And if you know when and where the market is, it doesn't cost much more than regular cheese

  	      So, I used to be dismissive of 'rich people food' when I thought it referred to that tier of bougie wannabe food that nobody could honestly enjoy, but I've learned since then that a meat and cheese board can actually be really tasty
