  	      find it quite upsetting thinking about the technologies of social control developed by and for large standing armies. eg decimation: punishing people by splitting them into groups of ten and making each nine of them bludgeon one who drew the short straw to death

  	      kind of wonder if a dark age is actually more ethical than a pax romana. but then, that probably wasn't great either. like how by the time of the french revolution there was theoretically enlistment but you could send someone else in your place

  	      so there'd be this two-tiered system, where the officers gallivant and the enlisted men just get shit on and killed. or how the chauvin that chauvinism is named after was napoleon's generalâ€”feels like 99% of toxic masculinity in the modern age has it's origin in basic training

  	      did they do a/b testing on what the best way to break people was, or just kind of figure it out intuitively? or were the traditions passed down over the centuries already good enough?
