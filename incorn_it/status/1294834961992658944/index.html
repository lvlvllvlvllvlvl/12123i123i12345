  	      Personally, I think we're due a paradigm shift from the Calvinist idea of work as a universal responsibility to instead seeing having a job as a privilege. It's not Henry Ford times any more; there just isn't enough meaningful work to go around. <a href="https://twitter.com/g_shullenberger/status/1294675587412328449">https://twitter.com/g_shullenberger/status/1294675587412328449</a>

  	      I, personally, have always enjoyed having a job. Idk if that makes me a pervert, or if I'm delusional to think that I'm contributing to society by performing wage labour, but I don't think I'm alone. If there are enough people around who want to work, why should everyone have to?
