  	      anyway, they (the child) doesn't think they have schizophrenia and doesn't want to see the doctor any more. my wife is mildly annoyed like "why did we go to all that trouble just to quit after 3 months" but l think it will be ok

  	      l really fucked up by not getting it done before we left the country. how are you supposed to get a mental health diagnosis in a country where you don't even speak the same language? found someone just down the road from us that specialized in autism but then just didn't book it
