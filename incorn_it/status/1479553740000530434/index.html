  	      Daughter cut herself with the knife we got her for xmas. Not sure if it was correct to mention having seen stuff like this when talking to her about it - don't want to get her seeing ill intent in every interaction online. <a href="https://twitter.com/blastrotek/status/1342732150815272960">https://twitter.com/blastrotek/status/1342732150815272960</a>

  	      Felt like it worked out ok. Included it in a list of things a parent would worry about after seeing their child self-harm, plus some constructive advice for each case. Did suggest therapy - might talk shit about therapists online, but she deserved to know it was an option

  	      She said she was fine, so left it at that. Would be hypocritical to get on her case, considering the most likely place she got the idea from. But tbh the way she smiled during the talk kind of made it feel like discord was involved.
