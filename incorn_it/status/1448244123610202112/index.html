  	      And I'm not talking about his private actions here. You don't need to read epstein's black book to find out if stallman is a bad person or not. You can see it in the philosophy and operating principles of the gnu foundation

  	      Whereas other open-source licenses are just licenses, minimal 'render unto caesar' tier concessions to the legal system to allow coders to get back to coding, gnu is an exercise in building and using power to control other people's actions. It sucks
