  	      He used to do the preaching by traumadumping thing that you get at the type of churches that do altar calls (like, "this is how fucked up I was before God saved me") and I had some understanding of psychology thanks to mom so it always seemed pretty clear to me how he worked

  	      Once walked into the kitchen and said "what are you talking about? Gay people? I used to hate gays but I don't any more" and he was like "what?" Wonder if that kind of interaction was why he groomed wraith instead of me? Or maybe he only liked boys, but then how would he know?

  	      Maybe I just wasn't receptive? I don't know about that though. When he took me on his motorbike I held the sissy bar out of habit and he said "you can hold my chest if you like" which I understood as a request despite the wording and obliged
