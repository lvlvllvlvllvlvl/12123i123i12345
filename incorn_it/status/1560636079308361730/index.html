  	      Apparently when my sister who is a year and a half older first saw me she said 'buddy' and my mom was so excited at her first word that she named me it. On a different occasion, mom said that her first word was 'birdie' and she'd said it a couple of weeks before I was born

  	      So when I chose my new name I tried to find a bird that I wanted to be called, settled on ibis. After a month or so wearing that name, decided that I didn't really like hearing people say it, and tried a completely different name for a while
