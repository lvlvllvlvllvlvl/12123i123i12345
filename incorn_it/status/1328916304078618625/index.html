  	      first thing she said was that while everything we said was confidential, she would contact someone if it appeared to her that i was a danger to myself or others. shortly after, in reference to my sister's suicide she asked me if i would ask for help if i ever felt suicidal

  	      before that i guess that she asked how i cope with difficult times and when i described it she said that was good. i used a weird phrase while describing it (didn't want to sound like i was reciting a textbook) and she's repeated that back at me several times now, which sucks

  	      anyway, i told her that it was hard to imagine what frame of mind i'd need to be in to want to kill myself, like, i'd hope that i'd ask for help but who knows how i'd be if i was feeling suicidal

  	      in abstract, i generally don't like asking for help - other people like to do things a different way than i like to do them, and i get frustrated. and of course i wouldn't ask for help killing myself from someone who had a professional duty to prevent it from happening

  	      towards the end of the last session she said she hadn't heard anything that would worry her or make her think that i shouldn't go ahead with my transition. it wasn't clear if that was supposed to be validation or a threat

  	      then she said she would like to see me again, i agreed, we discussed when, she asked if i thought the sessions had been helpful, i said yes, and she asked me what i liked about them. i fumbled the answer to that real bad, i hope i didn't offend her :(
