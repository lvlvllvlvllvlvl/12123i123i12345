  	      It is plausible that someone could like death note so much taht they choose the name 'Kiran â™¥' and then go on to make a death-note themed software product, but considering how flawless 'Kira's opsec is it seems more likely that it's a lampshady pseudonym.

  	      The person is literally a ghost. Came out of nowhere, spent 3 days developing and publishing an extension for both major browsers, posted it to reddit from a burner account. Terves and kiwifarms would love to know the real identity but there's literally nothing to find.
