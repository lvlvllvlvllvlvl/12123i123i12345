  	      He called me 5 or 6 years ago when his youngest was having gender, drunkenly ranting "I'm just an old bigot, I don't know how to deal with having a transgender child" (might not be an exact quote, but it's very close)

  	      I was in the office after everyone else had left, stayed on the line, sweetly calling him 'dad' as if he was my father (he appreciates that) for 3 hours. He told me "you're the only one who hasn't disappointed me," which felt bad.

  	      I don't even know what his issue with my older sister is. They last spoke before her 21st, when he asked her what she wanted for her birthday. All he will say about it is "she said she wanted a full length mirror" in a tone of voice like it's obvious what's bad about that

  	      To be fair, even at the time that didn't sound like him. But on the other hand he did say it. Even if he was drunk, he did say those words
