  	      The crew of a crashed WWII fighter plane are captured by cannibals. Eventually the leader visits them and says "in the time you have been captives here, you've learned our language, respected our customs and proven yourselves fine young men. We're inviting you to join the tribe."

  	      "We'll also grant you each one request." The first asks for something good to eat. They cook up a feast, then he joins the tribe and has a long and fulfilling life. The second wants to lose his virginity. Many tribe members find him attractive so this one is easy to grant.
