  	      This is why I frankly detest science as a discipline. It has no tests, no counterfactuals — it relies on telling a story which cannot be checked by anyone who doesn’t know the minutiae of the subject themselves. We cannot ever tell what has been omitted. <a href="https://twitter.com/zero_karma_l/status/1729711131222999187">https://twitter.com/zero_karma_l/status/1729711131222999187</a>

  	      l mean, l still believe in science even though l know it's rOtten to the core, because lm a neurotypical and choosing to believe things that are false is an important social bonding activity for us neurotypicals, but l would never judge someone for rejecting it.
