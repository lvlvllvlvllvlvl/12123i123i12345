  	      Obviously that's perverse, asking the parent for consent but not the child, so I told her that I wouldn't sign the form unless she wanted me to. She got me to write "I do not want my daughter to participate" so she could take it back to the teacher as proof

  	      We both got a zero for the test and after-school detention. I don't think my parents ever found out about it. They didn't even ask why I got 50% (30 was a pass, but it was the lowest grade I ever got by a long way) for woodworkingâ€”they'd seen the chair I made
